# [ReadySalted Boilerplate]

Derived from the popular HTML5 Boilerplate, ReadySalted is a minimal starting part for more experienced developers who want a quick responsive HTMl5 template. It doesn't suggest anything in terms of coding or visual style.

As a more balding developer the HTML5 Boilerplate has been a great kick up the bum to get up to date with the latest HTML5 trends - however it's also becoming annoying to have to strip it down every time, hence this repo.


## Quick start


Just clone it each time or download it and save it as a template in your favourite editor.

Clone - `git@github.com:specificgravity/readysalted-boilterplate.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/specificgravity/readysalted-boilterplate/zipball/master)
